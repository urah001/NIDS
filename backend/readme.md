# remember 
 remember to find a good dataset for the ML model 

 

### how it works:

* It's **sniffing packets** from your `wlan0` interface.
* For each packet, it's extract few features like `src_bytes`, `protocol_type`, etc.
* It passes those features through your `preprocess_function`.
* Then it uses the trained `RandomForestClassifier` to **predict whether it's normal or an intrusion**.
* If it's malicious (`prediction == 1`), it prints an alert and writes to `alerts.log`.

---

### üìä Next Steps (optional but useful):

#### 1. **Live dashboard for alerts**

* Since you already have a `Flask` backend (`backend_app.py`), you can build a simple frontend to fetch `/alerts` in real time using JavaScript.

#### 2. **Log more features**

* You're currently using a lot of `0`s in your 41-feature array:

  ```python
  features = [0, protocol_type, src_bytes, 0] + [0]*37
  ```
* You might want to extract more meaningful features like:

  * `dst_bytes`
  * `service`
  * `flag`
  * `logged_in`, etc.
* Or at least match what your model was trained on (from `modelTraining.py`).

#### 3. **Store alerts in a database**

* Instead of just `alerts.log`, you could use SQLite or PostgreSQL (you're already using Supabase, right?) to store alert history.

### üîç Want to test it?

You can generate traffic using tools like:

* `ping` or `curl` for normal packets.
* `nmap`, `hping3`, or `msfconsole` for simulating suspicious activity (e.g., port scans, DoS).

Example:

```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.x

```
