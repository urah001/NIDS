# remember 
 remember to find a good dataset for the ML model 

to run : 
 sudo "$(which python)" -u "/home/w3b/Documents/400Project/project/web-NIDS/backend/realtime_nids.py" 
 

### how it works:

* It's **sniffing packets** from your `wlan0` interface.
* For each packet, it's extract few features like `src_bytes`, `protocol_type`, etc.
* It passes those features through your `preprocess_function`.
* Then it uses the trained `RandomForestClassifier` to **predict whether it's normal or an intrusion**.
* If it's malicious (`prediction == 1`), it prints an alert and writes to `alerts.log`.

---

### 📊 Next Steps (optional but useful):

#### 1. **Live dashboard for alerts**

* Since you already have a `Flask` backend (`backend_app.py`), you can build a simple frontend to fetch `/alerts` in real time using JavaScript.

#### 2. **Log more features**

* You're currently using a lot of `0`s in your 41-feature array:

  ```python
  features = [0, protocol_type, src_bytes, 0] + [0]*37
  ```
* You might want to extract more meaningful features like:

  * `dst_bytes`
  * `service`
  * `flag`
  * `logged_in`, etc.
* Or at least match what your model was trained on (from `modelTraining.py`).

#### 3. **Store alerts in a database**

* Instead of just `alerts.log`, you could use SQLite or PostgreSQL (you're already using Supabase, right?) to store alert history.

### 🔍 Want to test it?

You can generate traffic using tools like:

* `ping` or `curl` for normal packets.
* `nmap`, `hping3`, or `msfconsole` for simulating suspicious activity (e.g., port scans, DoS).

Example:

```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.x

```

how to generate **abnormal/malicious-looking traffic** for testing The NIDS:

> ⚠️ **Use only on networks you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.**

---

### 🛠 1. **Port Scanning** (SYN scan)

```

sudo nmap -sS <target-ip>

```

This sends stealthy SYN packets (common for intrusion attempts).

---

### 🧨 2. **TCP SYN Flood (DoS Simulation)**

```bash
sudo hping3 -S <target-ip> -p 80 --flood
```

Explanation:

* `-S` = SYN flag
* `-p 80` = target port
* `--flood` = send as fast as possible (DoS-like behavior)

Stop with `Ctrl + C`.

---

### 🐍 3. **Ping of Death (ICMP flood)**

```bash
sudo hping3 -1 <target-ip> --flood
```

This uses ICMP (like ping), but floods it.

---

### 🔥 4. **Scan All Open Ports**

```bash
sudo nmap -p- <target-ip>
```

---

### 🦠 5. **XMAS Tree Scan (odd flags set)**

```bash
sudo nmap -sX <target-ip>
```

This sends packets with FIN, URG, and PSH flags — unusual behavior that some NIDS detect.

---

### ✅ To test against localhost:

If you're running your NIDS on the same system, you can test with:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 127.0.0.1
```

Or target a device on your LAN:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.5
```
