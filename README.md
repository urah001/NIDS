# how to run 

- to run the system or program , user first needs to navigate to the dir where the dashboard_server.py is located 
- then write this command :  sudo "$(which python)" -u "/home/w3b/Documents/400Project/project/web-NIDS/backend/dashboard_server.py" 
- ps this system was built in a kali linux eniviroment , which the reason for the `sudo` 
- the user needs to go to their localhost:5000 on their broswer or any server rendering application to view the ip causing intrusion on their network 
- this system has been trained by a dataset varified and collected for keggle and tested with CUSTECH wifi and it proved to very effective 
- this system detect and report intrusion 
- this system report : timestamp  alert  source-ip  destination-ip


# to run : 
 
 sudo "$(which python)" -u "/home/w3b/Documents/400Project/project/web-NIDS/backend/realtime_nids.py" 
 
 to run this file , user needs sudo/root priviledge to run this file therefore use this command in user is in linux : 

 ```
 sudo "$(which python)" -u "/home/w3b/Documents/400Project/project/web-NIDS/backend/realtime_nids.py"

### how it works:

* It's **sniffing packets** from your `wlan0` interface.
* For each packet, it's extract few features like `src_bytes`, `protocol_type`.
* It passes those features through your `preprocess_function`.
* Then it uses the trained `RandomForestClassifier` to **predict whether it's normal or an intrusion**.
* If it's malicious (`prediction == 1`), it prints an alert and writes to `alerts.log`.
* the intrusion/abnormal traffic it detect is : 

* SYN Flood	hping3 -S --flood -p 80 <target-ip>
* UDP Flood (Port 53)	hping3 --udp --flood -p 53 <target-ip>
* ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)	hping3 --icmp --flood <target-ip> OR ping -f <target-ip>
* Port Scan (Stealth)	nmap -sS <target-ip>
* Port Scan (Full)	nmap -p 1-1000 <target-ip>
* ARP Spoofing	arpspoof -i <iface> -t <target> <gateway>

### üîç Want to test it?

You can generate traffic using tools like:

 `ping` or `curl` for normal packets.
 `nmap`, `hping3`, or `msfconsole` for simulating suspicious activity (e.g., port scans, DoS).

Example:

```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.x

```

how to generate **abnormal/malicious-looking traffic** for testing The NIDS:


---
  1. **Port Scanning** (SYN scan)

```

sudo nmap -sS <target-ip>

```

This sends stealthy SYN packets (common for intrusion attempts).

---

### üß® 2. **TCP SYN Flood (DoS Simulation)**

```
sudo hping3 -S <target-ip> -p 80 --flood
```

Explanation:

* `-S` = SYN flag
* `-p 80` = target port
* `--flood` = send as fast as possible (DoS-like behavior)

Stop with `Ctrl + C`.

---

### üêç 3. **Ping of Death (ICMP flood)**

```
sudo hping3 -1 <target-ip> --flood
```

This uses ICMP (like ping), but floods it.

---

### üî• 4. **Scan All Open Ports**

```bash
sudo nmap -p- <target-ip>
```

---

### ü¶† 5. **XMAS Tree Scan (odd flags set)**

```bash
sudo nmap -sX <target-ip>
```

This sends packets with FIN, URG, and PSH flags ‚Äî unusual behavior that some NIDS detect.

---

### ‚úÖ To test against localhost:

If you're running your NIDS on the same system, you can test with:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 127.0.0.1
```

Or target a device on your LAN:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.5
```

# todo 
- remember to find a good dataset for the ML model for new test 
- check if dev can merge two or more dataset together to make a hybrid dataset to test and train the network
- try and make the system show normal data ( but think about this  , it might not be part of this methodology)

# incase of environment problem

deactivate  # if you are in venv
rm -rf venv

## Make sure your desired pyenv version is active:
pyenv global 3.x.x   # (replace with your real version)

## Check:
python --version  # ensure it's the pyenv version

## Recreate venv:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

## Upgrade pip to prevent this ever happening again:
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip install --upgrade pip

## Install Flask again:
pip install flask
